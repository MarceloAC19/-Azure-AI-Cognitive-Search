# Repository: Organizing and Searching Documents with Azure AI Search

This repository documents the completion of a hands-on lab focused on document organization and search techniques, using the powerful Artificial Intelligence tools from Microsoft Azure. The project follows the principles of data ingestion, creation of intelligent indexes, and exploration of organized data, as described in the challenge.

## üéØ Challenge Objective

The main objective of this lab is to apply and understand the process of data ingestion and indexing to extract valuable knowledge from large volumes of information. The central tool used for this task is **Azure AI Search** (formerly known as Azure Cognitive Search).

As a deliverable, this repository offers a detailed record of all the steps performed and the insights gained during the exploration of the search index.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

* **/README.md**: This main page, with the project overview.
* **/step-by-step.md**: A detailed guide with all the technical steps performed in Azure, based on the [Explore an Azure AI Search index (UI)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/11-ai-search.html) tutorial.
* **/insights.md**: Documentation with observations, conclusions, and insights extracted during the data exploration process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Prerequisites

* An active **Microsoft Azure** subscription.
* Access to **Azure AI Search** and a storage resource (Azure Blob Storage).
* Sample data (in this case, we used the data provided by the Microsoft Learn lab).
